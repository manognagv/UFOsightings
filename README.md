# UFOsightings
A DATA ANALYTIC project  which visualises and  analyses the UFO sightings Dataset that is taken from NUFORC reports.
There is no concrete reason as to why these
sightings are so prevalent worldwide and with
our project, we aim to come to an understanding
of said occurrences. For this, we are coming up
with a unique problem statement that talks about
predicting the next occurrence of UFO
sightings.This thrills us just as much as it does to
you. Through observing recurring patterns from
the data collected, we want to find out what
factors majorly influence such sightings and
subsequently predict future sightings. This not
only helps us answer a burning question but also
helps us look at this from a rational standpoint,
through proper observation and
analysis.Prediction makes it easy to experiment
as the occurrence has been predicted beforehand.
