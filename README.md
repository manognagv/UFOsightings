# UFOsightings
A Data Analytics project which visualises and analyses the UFO sightings dataset that is taken from NUFORC reports.
There is no concrete reason as to why these
sightings are so prevalent worldwide and with
our project, we aim to better understand this phenomena.
Our project aims at making predictions for future sightings.This thrills us just as much as it does to
you. Through observing recurring patterns from
the data collected, we want to find out what
factors that majorly influence such sightings and
subsequently predict future sightings. This not
only helps us answer a burning question but also
helps us look at this from a rational standpoint,
through proper observation and
analysis.Prediction makes it easy to experiment
as the occurrence has been predicted beforehand.
The final code is present in the UFO_Final.ipynb notebook for your reference.
